Come out to our second event in 2019 on March 13 from 12-1:20pm! 

WHO is this for?

- If you are new to R & are short-budgeted on time!
- If you'd like to start working with data in R without learning all the programming details first!!
- If you have a neat data set you'd like to explore and visualize!
- If you are a current R user but only familiar w/ base R!
- If you are unfamiliar with pipes
- If you have heard of tidyverse/dplyr/tidyr/tibble/ggplot but haven't had the chance to get started!

**If any/all of this is true, this event might be for you!**

WHAT we are planning!

- basics of tidyverse & ’tidy data’
- reshaping data with tidyr: gather, spread, separate, unite
- exploring data with dplyr: filter, select, mutate, transmute, arrange, summarise, group_by
- how tidy data talks to ggplot
- a quick summary of ggplot2
- finally, publication quality figures with R!
