# Motivation: Global Health and Economic Data

Throughout this section we will be analyzing global health and 
economic data. We will be exploring one question: 

1. Is there a relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita?

We will use the data that has been organized and delivered in the 
`gapminder` package available in an 
[R package from Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder).  

To install the `gapminder` data set

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("jennybc/gapminder")
```

## Loading data into R

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
```

### Meet the `gapminder` data frame or "tibble"

By loading the `gapminder` package, we now have access to a 
data frame by the same name. Get an overview of this with 
`str()`, which displays the structure of an object.

```{r}
str(gapminder)
```

`str()` will provide a sensible description of almost anything and,
worst case, nothing bad can actually happen. When in doubt, just 
`str()` some of the recently created objects to get some ideas a
bout what to do next.

We could print the `gapminder` object itself to screen. However, 
if you've used R before, you might be reluctant to do this, because
large datasets just fill up your console and provide very little insight.

This is the first big win for **tibbles**. The 
[`tidyverse`](https://github.com/hadley/tidyverse) offers a special 
case of R's default data frame: the "tibble", which is a nod to the 
actual class of these objects, `tbl_df`.

Now we can boldly print `gapminder` to screen! It is a 
tibble (and also a regular data frame) and the `tidyverse`
provides a nice print method that shows the most important 
stuff and doesn't fill up your Console.

```{r}
## see? it's still a regular data frame, but also a tibble
class(gapminder)
gapminder
```

This package provides a subset of the data provided by 
[Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/data/). The data comes as a 
data frame (or `tbl_df` if you're using `dplyr`). We can visit 
[Gapminder.org documentation page](http://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/) 
to obtain information about the columns:

| variable  | meaning                  |
|:----------|:-------------------------|
| country   |                          |
| continent |                          |
| year      |                          |
| lifeExp   | life expectancy at birth |
| pop       | total population         |
| gdpPercap | per-capita GDP           |


If you are dealing with plain vanilla data frames, you can rein in data frame printing explicitly with `head()` and `tail()`. Or turn it into a tibble with `as_tibble()`!

```{r}
head(gapminder)
tail(gapminder)
```

More ways to query basic info on a data frame:

```{r}
names(gapminder)
ncol(gapminder)
length(gapminder)
dim(gapminder)
nrow(gapminder)
```

A statistical overview can be obtained with `summary()`

```{r}
summary(gapminder)
```

Although we haven't begun our formal coverage of 
visualization yet, it's so important for smell-testing 
dataset that we will make a few figures anyway. 
Here we use only base R graphics, which are very basic.

```{r first-plots-base-R}
plot(lifeExp ~ year, gapminder)
plot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, gapminder)
plot(lifeExp ~ log(gdpPercap), gapminder)
```



# Welcome to the "Tidyverse"

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) is _"an opinionated 
collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages 
share an underlying philosophy and common APIs."_ 

Another way of putting it is that it's a set of packages 
that are useful specifically for data manipulation, 
exploration and visualization with a common philosphy. 

## What is this common philosphy? 

The common philosphy is called _"tidy"_ data. It is 
a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset
to its structure.

In _tidy_ data:

* Each variable forms a column.
* Each observation forms a row.
* Each type of observational unit forms a table.

```{r out.width = "95%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://r4ds.had.co.nz/images/tidy-1.png")
```

Below, we are interested in transformating the table on 
the right to the the table on the left, which is 
considered "tidy". 

```{r out.width = "95%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://r4ds.had.co.nz/images/tidy-9.png")
```

Working with tidy data is useful because it creates a structured way of
organizing data values within a data set. This makes the data analysis 
process more efficient and simplifies the development of data analysis tools
that work together. In this way, you can focus on the problem you are
investigating, rather than the uninteresting logistics of data.  

## What is in the `tidyverse`? 

We can install and load the set of R packages using 
`install.packages("tidyverse")` function. 

When we load the tidyverse package using `library(tidyverse)`, 
there are six core R packages that load:

* [readr](http://readr.tidyverse.org), for data import.
* [tidyr](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org), for data tidying.
* [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org), for data wrangling.
* [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org), for data visualisation.
* [purrr](http://purrr.tidyverse.org), for functional programming.
* [tibble](http://tibble.tidyverse.org), for tibbles, a modern re-imagining of data frames.

Here, we load in the tidyverse. 
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Because these packages all share the "tidy" philosphy, 
the data analysis workflow is easier as you move from 
package to package. 

Today we will focus on `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, for 
data wrangling and visualiation, but definitely check 
out the other packages such as `readr`,
`tidyr`, R packages to import data, 
to transform data to the "tidy" format. 


# Data wrangling 

In the real world, analyzing data rarely involves 
data that can be easily imported and ready for 
analysis. According to Wikipedia:

> Data munging or data wrangling is loosely the process 
of manually converting or mapping data from one "raw" 
form into another format that allows for more convenient 
consumption of the data with the help of semi-automated 
tools.

As you will see in class, one of the most 
time-consuming aspects of the data analysis 
process is "data wrangling". This is also 
is a trendy term for 
_cleaning up a messy data set_. 

R provides incredibly powerful and flexible language 
for data wrangling. However, the syntax is somewhat 
hard to get used to. We will therefore introducing 
a package that makes the syntax much more like 
the English language. This package is `dplyr`. 

## The `dplyr` R package

[`dplyr`](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html) 
is a powerful R-package to transform and summarize 
tabular data with rows and columns. 

The package contains a set of functions 
(or "verbs") to perform common data manipulation
operations such as filtering for rows, selecting 
specific columns, re-ordering rows, adding new 
columns and summarizing data. 

In addition, `dplyr` contains a useful function to
perform another common task which is the is the 
"split-apply-combine" concept.  We will discuss 
that in a little bit. 

### How does it compare to using base functions R?

If you are familiar with R, you are probably familiar 
with base R functions such as `split()`, `subset()`, 
`apply()`, `sapply()`, `lapply()`, `tapply()` and 
`aggregate()`. Compared to base functions in R, the 
functions in `dplyr` are easier to work with, are 
more consistent in the syntax and are targeted for 
data analysis around data frames instead of just vectors. 

The important `dplyr` verbs to remember are: 

`dplyr` verbs | Description
--- | ---
`select()` | select columns 
`filter()` | filter rows
`arrange()` | re-order or arrange rows
`mutate()` | create new columns
`summarize()` | summarize values
`group_by()` | allows for group operations in the "split-apply-combine" concept



### Pipe operator: %>%

Before we go any futher, let's introduce the 
pipe operator: `%>%`. In our `stocks` example,
we briefly saw this symbol. It is called the
pipe operator. `dplyr` imports
this operator from another package 
(`magrittr`)
[see help file here](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html). 
This operator allows you to pipe the output 
from one function to the input of another
function. Instead of nesting functions 
(reading from the inside to the 
outside), the idea of of piping is to 
read the functions from left to right. 

### `dplyr` verbs in action

The two most basic functions are `select()` and 
`filter()` which selects columns and filters 
rows, respectively. 

#### Selecting columns using `select()`

To select all the columns *except* a 
specific column, use the "-" (subtraction) operator 
(also known as negative indexing). 

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    select(-lifeExp)
```

The function `select()` is much more 
powerful though. To select a range 
of columns by name, use the ":" (colon) operator

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  select(lifeExp:gdpPercap)
```

To select all columns that start with the 
character string "c", use the function `starts_with()`

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  select(starts_with("c"))
```

Some additional options to select columns based 
on a specific criteria include

1. `ends_with()` = Select columns that end with 
a character string
2. `contains()` = Select columns that contain 
a character string
3. `matches()` = Select columns that match a 
regular expression
4. `one_of()` = Select columns names that are 
from a group of names


#### Selecting rows using `filter()`

Let's say we only want the data from 2007. 

To do this, we can use the `filter()` function 
to filter the rows for years in 2007. 

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == "2007")
```

**Note**: you can use the boolean operators 
(e.g. `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`, `%in%`) 
to create logical tests.

For example, if we wanted only years 
after 2014, we can add a second criteria: 

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year > 1977)
```


#### Use `mutate()` to add new variables

`mutate()` is a function that defines and inserts new 
variables into a tibble. You can refer to existing
variables by name.

```{r}
gapminder %>%
    filter(year==2007) %>% 
    select(-continent) %>%
    mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap)
```


#### Arrange or re-order rows using `arrange()`

To arrange (or re-order) rows by a particular 
column such as the population, list the name of 
the column you want to arrange the rows by

```{r}
gapminder %>%     
    filter(year==2007) %>%
    select(-continent) %>%
    mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
    arrange(gdp)
```


So if we wanted to figure out what were the top three
countries with the largest `gdpPercap` in 2007, we could 
use the `desc()` function inside of
`arrange()` to order rows in a descending order. 

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  arrange(desc(gdpPercap)) %>% 
  head(n=3)
```


# Data visualization 

## ggplot2

[`ggplot2`](http://ggplot2.org) is a powerful data exploration and 
visualization package that can create graphics in R. It was created by 
[Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz) when he was a graduate student at 
Iowa State University and is based on the principals defined in the 
[Grammar of Graphics](http://www.amazon.com/The-Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448).  


#### Why is it useful?

The idea of the Grammar of Graphics is to break the graph into components 
and handle the components of a graph separately. The `ggplot2` package 
contains a set of functions that allow us to build the features of the
graph in a series of layers for versatility and control. 

There are two main plotting functions in `ggplot2`: 

* `qplot()` = a quick plot, similar to the `plot()` function in base R
* `ggplot()` = a "grammar of graphics" (gg) plot which is made up two 
components (a `ggplot()` object and at least one `geom` layer)

The `ggplot2` is loaded whenever you load `tidyverse`, but you can 
always load it formally. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

## Life expectancy and GDP per capita

To try and answer our first question we will make a _scatterplot_. 
We will do this for the latest entry in our database which is:

```{r}
max( gapminder$year )
```

We will first make a quick plot of these two variables. 

#### `qplot`

The `qplot` function  allows us to produce simple plots, similar to 
`plot` in base R.  The main input of `qplot` is an `x` and `y` argument, 
but it also accepts a data set (`data`) where the `x` and `y` variables are 
located.  

To create a scatter-plot of life expectancy versus GDP per capita 
for 2007, we start by creating a subset of the data with only the 2007 year.

```{r}
dat <- filter(gapminder, year==2007)
```

Why does this not work?

```{r,eval=FALSE}
qplot(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp) 
```

We need to specify where to get these values from. Instead, we can
use the vectors of `dat` directly

```{r}
## need to specify where variables are located
qplot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp) 
```

However, a cleaner way to do this does not define `dat` and instead uses the `data` argument:
```{r}
## instead of having to specify name of data frame each time, just list it once
qplot(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, data = filter(gapminder, year==2007))
```


If youw ant to add labels to the x and y axis, you can use the 
`xlab` and `ylab` arguments. You can read the help file to 
check out other arguments available in the function. 

```{r}
qplot(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, 
      data = filter(gapminder, year==2007), 
      xlab = "GDP per Capita", 
      ylab = "Life Expectancy", 
      main = "Data from Gapminder")
```

From this plot, we see that there is a wide variability in 
life expectancy for the lower income countries and then 
somewhat of a positive trend. However, there are many 
countries with incomes below 5,000 dollars per person and 
it is hard to see differences between these. Next we 
will now learn about the grammar of graphics and create 
a series of visualizations.

## `ggplot`

This function is the implementation of the "Grammar of Graphics" 
that allows us to build layers of graphical elements to produce
plots. As explained by Hadley Wickham

> the grammar tells us that a statistical graphic is a mapping from data to aesthetic attributes (colour, shape, size) of geometric objects (points, lines, bars). The plot may also contain statistical transformations of the data and is drawn on a specific coordinates system.

#### Terminology 
* **ggplot** - the main function where you specify the data set and variables to plot (this is where we define the `x` and
`y` variable names)
* **geoms** - geometric objects
    * e.g. `geom_point()`, `geom_bar()`, `geom_line()`, `geom_histogram()`
* **aes** - aesthetics
    * shape, transparency, color, fill, linetype
* **scales** - define how your data will be plotted
    * continuous, discrete, log, etc

There are three ways to initialize a `ggplot()` object. 

An empty ggplot object

```{r}
ggplot()         
```

A ggplot object associated with a dataset

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    filter(year==2007) %>% 
    ggplot()
```

or a ggplot object with a dataset and `x` and `y` defined

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    filter(year==2007) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
```


#### Creating your first ggplot()

We just used the function `aes()` which is an aesthetic mapping 
function inside the `ggplot()` object. We use this function to 
specify plot attributes (e.g. `x` and `y` variable names) that 
will not change as we add more layers.  

Anything that goes in the `ggplot()` object becomes
a global setting.  From there, we use the `geom` objects to add 
more layers to the base `ggplot()` object. 
These will define what we are interested in 
illustrating using the data.  

Earlier we noticed that there are many countries with 
incomes below 5,000 dollars per person and it is hard to see 
differences between these. We can examine just this variable 
with a histogram. Here we would use a different geometry:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    filter(year==2007) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=gdpPercap)) + geom_histogram()
```

The histogram shows very large tails. We may do better by 
transforming the data. For data like this, the log 
transformation seems to work well. It also has a nice economic 
interpretation related to percent growth: in $log_{10}$ a 
change of 1 means the country is 10 times richer.

So how do we make the x-axis in the log scale? It is convenient to have [this](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) cheat sheet around when using ggplot2. From there we see that `scale_x_log10` does what we want.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    filter(year==2007) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=gdpPercap)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins=25) + 
    scale_x_log10()
```

We no longer see extreme tails. The scatter plot now looks much more informative:

Now we can remake the scatter plot but now make 
sure the x-axis is in a log-scale

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    filter(year==2007) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_point() + scale_x_log10()
```

We can also do this:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    filter(year==2007) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=log10(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_point()
```

We can also use other really great packages, such as `ggrepel`: 

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
gapminder %>% 
    filter(year==2007) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_point(color = 'red',) + scale_x_log10() + 
    geom_text_repel(aes(label = country), size = 2) +
  theme_classic() 
```

Now you are ready to make presentation quality data visualizations!
