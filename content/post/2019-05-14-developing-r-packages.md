Come out to our third event in 2019 on May 22nd from 5:30-7pm! 

WHO is this for?

- If you are new to R & are short-budgeted on time!
- If you have R code that you want to convert into an R package, but don't know how!
- If you want to learn about how others create R packages!

*If any/all of this is true, this event might be for you!*

WHAT we are planning!

Genevieve Stein-O’Brien (https://twitter.com/genesofeve) will introduce
the basics of R packages and teach how to develop your own R package. 
We will also have an additional speaker sharing some tips on things to 
avoid and suggestions on tutorials that are helpful!
