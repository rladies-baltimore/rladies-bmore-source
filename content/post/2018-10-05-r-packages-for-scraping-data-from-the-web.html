<p>Come out to our first event in 2019 on January 23 from 5:30-7pm!</p>
<p>We will discuss really useful R packages that can be used to scrape data from the web by walking through some vignettes and tutorials. We plan to focus on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/README.html">rvest</a>. From the CRAN website it says <em>“rvest helps you scrape information from web pages. It is designed to work with <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/magrittr">magrittr</a> to make it easy to express common web scraping tasks, inspired by libraries like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/">beautifulsoup</a>.”</em> If you don’t know what any of that means, no worries! We’ll explain the basics and hopefully get you off and running towards scraping data for your own projects!</p>
